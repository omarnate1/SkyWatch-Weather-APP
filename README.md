Overview
Weather refers to the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time. It includes a variety of meteorological elements such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and atmospheric pressure. These elements are constantly changing due to various atmospheric phenomena, such as the movement of air masses and the interactions between different layers of the atmosphere. Weather forecasting uses scientific models and data to predict changes in the weather, which helps us prepare for potentially dangerous or disruptive weather conditions. Understanding and monitoring the weather is important for a variety of activities, including agriculture, transportation, and outdoor recreation.
Goals
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Software Engineering Year at ALX.
